This is the first public release of Birc IRC client.

Please note, that Birc is written as a university homework, and is mainly a
proof of concept.



INSTALLATION

I can't recommend installing it system wide in a multiuser environment.


1. Copy birc.sh to your PATH.

2. Copy birc.1 to man's path.


BUGS

Report Birc bugs to Mate Ory <orymate@ubuntu.com>.
